## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to simplify the management of a company's employee database. My motivation for building this project stemmed from a desire to create a practical tool that streamlines the process of managing employee information. Rather than relying on manual data entry or complex database interfaces, I wanted to provide a straightforward solution that allows users to efficiently add, view, update, and delete employee details with ease.

This project addresses the common challenge faced by businesses in organizing and maintaining employee data. By offering a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with a MySQL database, the Employee Tracker provides a convenient solution for tracking employee names, roles, salaries, and departments. It streamlines the management process, saving time and effort for business owners and managers.

Through building this application, I gained valuable experience in using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to develop command-line applications. I learned how to structure and manage database queries, handle user input, and implement error handling to ensure smooth application functionality. Additionally, I honed my skills in project planning, database design, and software development, contributing to my overall growth as a programmer.
